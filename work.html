				<h2>BFA Exhibition</h2>

				<p>The last major hurdle that I cleared before graduating was my BFA Exhibition. It was held in the Colonel Eugene E. Myers Art Gallery in the Hughes Fine Art Center on the University of North Dakota campus from November 26-29. Entitled "Pictures Worth Countless Words", I recreated well-known photographs using only type, which was generated from my research of each particular photograph. Articles, interviews, accounts, and even diary exerpts were the building blocks of my final designs. I received tremendous feedback and couldn't have been more pleased with the outcome.</p>

				<h2>Just The Facts Campaign</h2>

				<p>In this campaign I worked with the University of North Dakota Health and Wellness Hub to create a noticeable campaign centered around engaging facts regarding alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. The goal of the campaign was to target all students, faculty, and staff and decrease the consumption of the substances emphasized. The consistent look and feel of materials created a buzz and interest, causing viewers to stop and read the content when new facts came out. This Campaign was distributed across campus in a variety of sizes and medias such as large posters, flyers, screens, and window clings. Overall, it was a very successful and engaging campaign.</p>

				<h2>2012 Fall Intramurals Campaign</h2>

				<p>In this campaign I worked with the RecSports coordinator at the UND Wellness Center to increase both interest and awareness of the upcoming intramural sports. I utilized old photographs taken of intramural sports throughout the years at the University, and wrote clever copy to correspond with each one. This project was largely successful, creating and implementing the motto "Why would you want to sit out?" and proving to be a fresh and humorous way to engage students, faculty, and staff. It was distributed across campus in a variety of sizes and medias such as large posters, flyers, and screens. This was a very enjoyable project to envision, strategize, carry out, and deploy.</p>

				<h2>2012 Green Gallop Homecoming Spirit Run</h2>

				<p>The University of North Dakota Homecoming Spirit Run was a 1.5 mile, 5K, and 10K family walk/run hosted by the UND Wellness Center. In this project I worked closely with the event coordinator, and handled nearly all the design work associated with it. This included developing the logo and branding the entire event. On the print side there were posters, flyers, table tents, route maps, handouts, T-shirts, and banners, including a parade banner and Start and Finish Banners. The Spirit Run was also promoted campus-wide using screens, web sliders, and both the Health & Wellness Unit and the Wellness Center Facebook page with customized Cover design. The event was very successful, and well, looked good.</p>

				<h2>UND Health and Wellness Unit Typographical Branding</h2>

				<p>The University of North Dakota Health and Wellness Unit consists of many different branches, and was in need of strong brand to unify it. Consisting of the Health & Wellness Hub, Student Health Services, the University Counseling Center, the Wellness Center, Work Well, and Financial Wellness, the unit offers a wide variety of services and fills many different roles. I created a consistent look and feel for materials in which the entire unit was represented, as well as a branding element to be used on individual promotional materials, tying it to the rest of the unit.</p>
